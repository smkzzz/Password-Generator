# Password-Generator

This is a web application that allows users to generate random, secure passwords. It has a simple user interface that consists of a text field where the generated password is displayed, a range slider that allows users to set the password length, and checkboxes that let users specify which types of characters (letters, numbers, and symbols) should be included in the password.

When the user adjusts the password length or character type options, the app will automatically generate a new password using the specified settings. The user can then copy the password to their clipboard by clicking the "Copy Password" button.

The app is written in HTML and JavaScript. The HTML file contains the markup for the user interface elements, including the text field, range slider, checkboxes, and buttons. The JavaScript file contains the logic for generating the password, responding to user input, and updating the UI. It uses various string and array methods, as well as event listeners, to enable the app's functionality.
